# kubekutr

_Cookie cutter for Kubernetes resource manifests._

## Features

- Leverages over `kustomize` to create bespoke configuration.
- Creates an opinionated `GitOps` directory to store manifests and apply configuration changes.
- Harnesses Go Templates to create a basic but close to an actual looking manifest with a more human friendly config file.
